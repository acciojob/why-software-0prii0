	<h1>"Why I want to become a developer?"</h1>
	<p>My journey toward becoming a software developer stems from a deep passion for problem-solving and a natural curiosity for how technology shapes the world around us. From a young age, I was fascinated by how websites and applications functioned behind the scenes. This curiosity led me to explore coding, where I discovered the thrill of turning ideas into functional solutions.</p>
